Description: Implements sentiment analysis using huggingface <https://huggingface.co> transformer zero-shot classification model pipelines. The default pipeline is Cross-Encoder's DistilRoBERTa <https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base> trained on the Stanford Natural Language Inference <https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/> and Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference <https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_nli> datasets. Using similar models, zero-shot classification transformers have demonstrated superior performance relative to other natural language processing models <arXiv:1909.00161>. All other zero-shot classification model pipelines can be implemented using their model name from <https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=zero-shot-classification>}.
