## Goal of the tutorial

The goal of the tutorial is to demonstrate the functionalities of `transforEmotion` R package for sentiment analysis, facial expression recognition and RAG.
This is an R package that uses the power of HuggingFace `transformers` library in Python
to run model inference and perform various tasks. The tutorial will go through two
examples from the MAFW dataset. MAFW is a dataset which has large number of short videos which
are annotated (with the dominant emotion) and also have a detailed description of the
video using emotionally neutral language. The tutorial will also go through all
functionalities of the package and demostrate the use of three different models. The aim
of the tutorial is to make these tasks easy to understand, follow and apply by
communication science researches. All code can be run locally, on a CPU in reasonable
time, without need to pay for anything or run anything on a remote server. This fosters
reproducible, open science with privacy in mind, making this package usable in
communications research in situations where privacy and confidentiality is paramount.

Overview 

Generative AI (GenAI) is revolutionizing the communication landscape, enabling machines to generate diverse forms of content such as text, audio, and multimedia. These advances hold immense potential for reshaping how we understand media, as they facilitate faster, more personalized, and scalable content production. However, they also raise significant questions about the ethical implications, accuracy, and societal impacts of machine-generated content. As a result, human-machine communication is emerging as a critical area of inquiry that explores how humans interact with AI-generated content, how GenAI tools can be harnessed to achieve desired societal outcomes, and how these systems shape broader communication ecosystems.

In communication research, GenAI introduces new opportunities both as a subject of study and as a methodological tool. Researchers are increasingly exploring how AI-driven content influences public discourse, media production, and audience engagement. At the same time, GenAI is being integrated into research workflows, offering innovative computational solutions for data generation and analysis. This special issue of Computational Communication Researchwill focus on the diverse ways in which GenAI intersects with communication science, from its theoretical implications to its practical applications in research.

We invite submissions on a wide range of computational communication research topics, including studies on AI’s role in media, public discourse, news production, and other communication phenomena. All submissions must employ computational methods to answer communication research questions.

1. Research Articles: We seek manuscripts that make substantive contributions to communication science by employing computational techniques to study GenAI, either as a communication phenomenon or as a research tool for understanding communication processes and human-AI or AI-AI interactions. Two broad sub-themes emerge under this category:

a. Generative AI as the Object of Research: Manuscripts in this sub-theme should apply computational techniques to investigate GenAI as a communication technology. Some examples include studies that:

Analyze large datasets of machine-generated content.

Apply network analysis to explore how GenAI impacts information diffusion.

Study how AI-generated media affects public discourse and engagement.

Compare AI and human interactions in various platforms, focusing on trust, information exchange, and relationship building.

Evaluate the effectiveness of GenAI tools for misinformation detection.

These articles should use computational methods to analyze the influence of AI-generated content on communication systems and focus on its societal implications.

b. Generative AI as a Methodological Tool: Manuscripts in this sub-theme should demonstrate how computational techniques involving GenAI are used to conduct empirical communication research. Submissions need to go beyond the simple one-shot use of GenAI for dataset generation, content coding, stimuli creation, or agent simulation, by 1) integrating innovative and creative uses of GenAI, or 2) complementing the coding process with robust validation measures, or 3) illuminating potential issues such as biases, hallucinations, etc. Some examples include studies that:

Use GenAI to generate synthetic datasets for communication research.

Use GenAI to annotate or classify communication data, including multimodal data.

Use GenAI to create experimental stimuli.

Use GenAI to develop agents that simulate human behavior.

We also welcome meta-analyses and synthesizing papers that aggregate and assess existing computational research on GenAI’s methodological potential in communication studies, with attention to these AI methodologies’ accuracy, scalability, and reliability.

2. Software Demonstration Articles: Besides traditional research articles, we invite Software Demonstration Articles that introduce new tools, platforms, or software designed to incorporate GenAI into communication research workflows. These articles should offer practical tutorials or demonstrations of software that computational researchers can adopt to integrate GenAI into their empirical work. The emphasis is on practical, open-source tools and frameworks that make it easier for other computational researchers to implement AI-driven methods in their own studies.

Submissions that explore the integration of GenAI with other computational methods and address the ethical considerations surrounding these technologies (such as bias, transparency, replicability, and societal impact) are highly encouraged. We also encourage submissions representing diverse geographical localities, cultural considerations, and disciplinary traditions.

Computational Communication Research is an open-access journal, free for both authors and readers. All accepted papers will be published under a Creative Commons Attribution license.
