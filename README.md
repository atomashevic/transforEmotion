## transforEmotion: Sentiment Analysis for Text and Qualitative Data

Implements sentiment analysis using [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) transformer zero-shot classification model pipelines. The default pipeline is [Cross-Encoder's DistilRoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base) trained on the [Stanford Natural Language Inference](https://huggingface.co/datasets/snli) (SNLI) and [Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference](https://huggingface.co/datasets/multi_nli) (MultiNLI) datasets. Using similar models, zero-shot classification transformers have demonstrated superior performance relative to other natural language processing models (Yin, Hay, & Roth, [2019](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.00161)). All other zero-shot classification model pipelines can be implemented using their model name from https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=zero-shot-classification.

## How to Install
```
if(!"devtools" %in% row.names(installed.packages())){
  install.packages("devtools")
}

devtools::install_github("AlexChristensen/transforEmotion")
```

## How to Use
Start by loading the package into R
```
# Load package
library(transforEmotion)
```

### Example Data
Next load some data with text for analysis. The example below uses item descriptions from the personality trait extraversion in the NEO-PI-R inventory found on the [IPIP](https://ipip.ori.org/newNEOFacetsKey.htm) website.
```
# Load data
data(neo_ipip_extraversion)
```

For the example, the positively worded item descriptions will be used
```
# Example text 
text <- neo_ipip_extraversion$friendliness[1:5]
```

### DistilRoBERTa
Next, the text can be loaded in the function `transformer_scores()` to obtain the probability that item descriptions correspond to a certain class. The classes defined below are the facets of extraversion in the NEO-PI-R. The example text data draws from the friendliness facet
```
# Cross-Encoder DistilRoBERTa
transformer_scores(
 text = text,
 classes = c(
   "friendly", "gregarious", "assertive",
   "active", "excitement", "cheerful"
 )
)
```

The default transformer model is [DistilRoBERTa](https://huggingface.co/cross-encoder/nli-distilroberta-base). The model is fast and accurate.

### BART
Another model that can be used is [BART](https://huggingface.co/facebook/bart-large-mnli), a much larger and more computationally intensive model (slower prediction times). The BART model tends to be more accurate but the accuracy gains above DistilRoBERTa are negotiatiable
```
# Facebook BART Large
transformer_scores(
 text = text,
 classes = c(
   "friendly", "gregarious", "assertive",
   "active", "excitement", "cheerful"
 ),
 transformer = "facebook-bart"
)
```

### Any Text Classification Model with a Pipeline on [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=zero-shot-classification) 
Text classification models with a pipeline on huggingface can be used so long as there is a pipeline available for them. Below is an example of [Typeform's DistilBERT](https://huggingface.co/typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli) model
```
# Directly from huggingface: typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli
transformer_scores(
 text = text,
 classes = c(
   "friendly", "gregarious", "assertive",
   "active", "excitement", "cheerful"
 ),
 transformer = "typeform/distilbert-base-uncased-mnli"
)
```
